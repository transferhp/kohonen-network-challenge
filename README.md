<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Kohonen Self Organizing Map (SOM) provides a data visualization technique which helps to understand high dimensional data by reducing the dimensions of data to a map. SOM also represents clustering concept by grouping similar data together.

Unlike other learning technique in neural networks, training a SOM requires no target vector. A SOM learns to classify the training data without any external supervision.

In this challenge, I will implement a SOM such that it can categorise a set of
 random 3-dimensional colours. The output should be an image of the organised data.
